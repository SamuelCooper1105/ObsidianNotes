Homework is just on chapter 2.

So here we go,

A production facility manufactures steel plates used for construction out of two types of steel,
Black Iron (BI) and Galvanized Iron (GI). All plates are inspected to see if they meet
specifications prior to shipment. The table below describes the results of one weeks’ worth of
inspections.

|     |     | Meets specifications | Does Not meet specifications |
| --- | --- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
|     | BI  | 317                  | 42                           |
|     | GI  | 30                   | 11                           |
There are 400 total plates
Let A denote the event that the plate is made from BI.
Let B denote the event that the plate meets specifications during inspection.
Determine the number of outcomes in each of the following cases (2.5 points each):
a) B’
	If B is the event that the plate meets specifications, there fore B' must be the event where the plate does not meet the specifications. The number of outcomes where a plate does not meet specifications is 53
b) A∩B’'
if event A is a plate made from BI and B' is an event where a plate does not meet specifications then then the number of outcomes of the union of A $\cap$ B' will be 42
c) A∪B
	$A\cup B$ = 317 + 30 = 347
d) A∩B
	317
