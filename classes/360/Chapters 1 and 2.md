Probability and statistics:
probablity is a branch of mathematical science whereas statistics is a branch of applied mathematical science.
Probablity, is a science of chance or uncertainties, looks at possible outcomes and the given change of those outcomes happening. This provides the foundation for statistics.
Statisitics, is an applied science of collecting, processing, presentation, analyzing and interpretation of data. This is used to make decisions solve problems and design processes. 

## Chapter 2
A random experiment can result in different outcomes, using probablity theory the tools for mathematical calculation for the chances of those various outcomes actually happening. (Nothing ever happens).
So to begin doing this we need to list all the possible outcomes, which is called the Sample Space, denoted with S.

Combination of events is denoted with unions, intersections, and compliments.
So a union $\cup$ is the set of all outcomes that are contained within either of two events.
An intersection, $\cap$ is the set that contains the outcomes that are contained in both of the events.
A compliment of an event consists of all outcomes that are not contained in the event.
Two mutually exclusive events is defined as $E_1 \cap E_2 = \emptyset$, or that one event does not affect the other.
