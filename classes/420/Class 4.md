create a doubly linked list for each input file, each node should contain a string i.e. a word, along with a count that counts however many instances of that word.
I think this could be done by going through each input file, going through each of the words, checking if a word is is already in the linked list by iterating through the list and checking if the word is equavlanet to the word in a node if it is, then increase the count, if not then insert a new node with that word as the word part of the node. 
use insert sort to go through the list and sort them alphabetically. 

It's going to be tricky comparing the two lists as there is no guarantee that common words exist, you might be able to just check the first letter of a word and then go from there. 

you could add an adidtional data in your node with the first letter of the word, this is checked first and then move on to 


my professor said that the propbablity of the union of two mutually exclusive events is equal to the probablity of the first event added to the probablity of the second event. how does what you showed me follow that rule?
