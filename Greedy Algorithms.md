Greedy algorithm's make choices based on what was most optimal at the time of the decision. This approcah assumes that whatever the current most optimal choice is, will ultimately lead to the globally optimal solution. However we can only use greedy algorithms under certain conditions.

#### Property 1.
- A globally optimal solution can be arrived at by makinga series of local optimal choices.
#### Property 2.
- A problem echibits optimal substructure if the the optimal oslution to a problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems.
If a problem does not have these properties a greedy algorithm may not work at all.

So let's illustrate this with an example. COnsidering we want to palce values in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total profit. we can also break up items to find the most
