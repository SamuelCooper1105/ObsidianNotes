- probability is a branch of mathematical science 
- statistics is a branch of applied mathematical science
variations of this include existence and importance 

we can have different outcomes or outputs these are affected by *controllable* and *noise*. These randoms variables introduce variablity in the system. A main goal of engineering statisitics is to understand, quantify and model the variation
A main goal of engineering statistics is to understand, quantify and model any variation.

goals are informed decisions or judgement based on the understanding of the variation within the system. 
there are deterministic and stochastic cases. 
#### Chapter 2:
Random Experiments: these can have different outcomes
probability theory provides mathematical tools for calculating the chances or likelihood of various outcomes actually occuring.

The first step for this is too list all the possible outcomes.
